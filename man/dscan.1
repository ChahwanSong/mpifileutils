.SH NAME
dscan \- distributed directory scanner with histogram and oldest-entry reporting
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dscan
[\fIOPTION\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBdscan\fR walks a directory tree in parallel using MPI and generates a JSON
report containing:
.sp
- file size histogram
- atime/mtime/ctime histograms for files and directories
- oldest top-K items for atime/mtime/ctime, including path, timestamps, and size
- broken-path list
.sp
Directory size in top-K output is computed as the sum of all regular-file sizes
under that directory subtree.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-directory PATH
Directory tree to scan. Required.
.TP
.B \-o, \-\-output FILE
Write JSON output to FILE. Required.
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-print
Print a human-readable summary to stdout on rank 0.
.TP
.B \-k, \-\-top-k N
Number of oldest entries to report for each timestamp field.
Default is 10.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Enable verbose logging.
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
Suppress verbose logging.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print usage.
.SH BROKEN-PATH RULES
.sp
An item is marked broken when one or more conditions hold:
.sp
- abnormal_size: regular file size is larger than 1 PiB
- missing: path does not exist
- abnormal_time: atime/mtime/ctime older than 10 years or in the future
- unreadable: file or directory cannot be opened/read
.SH EXAMPLE
.sp
\fBmpirun -np 8 dscan --directory /data --output report.json --top-k 25 --print\fR
